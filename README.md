Hi, Alice here.
I'm a Le Wagon graduate currently working as a web dev teaching assistant in London. 
My journey started with Ruby (Rails) and I'm currently learning Python.

Previous to my coding journey I spent 15 years working in business development in e-commerce and travel, both in Corporate and start-up environments. I speak 4 languages and have lived and worked in Europe, the US and Asia where I managed teams of high performing Market Managers. I love working with people from different cultures and backgrounds. 
After growing my market’s revenue I was chosen to project manage the launch of 2 new strategic EMEA offices and recruit, manage and develop staff there. 

There are so many transferable skills I take from my sales journey, but the key ones I believe will help me grow in the software engineering role are: 
- My strong sense of ownership and being organized which was invaluable in project management assignments
- Extensive experience leading teams and working with different departments / communication styles
- Working autonomously with little supervision
- Strong interpersonal skills. I love meeting new people and understanding how they tick.

When I’m not thinking about coding or hotels you’ll find me contemplating about one of the following:
- When does the next season of Black Mirror finally start?
- Why isn’t the 70s boardgame Mastermind a staple in every 2023 household?
- Who else can I recommend Hannah Fry’s “Hello World” book to?
- How can I better memorize the step sequence of my tap dance routine?
- Which glaze do I want to use for my latest pottery project?

Do get in touch, especially if you are hiring and think we can work together well!
